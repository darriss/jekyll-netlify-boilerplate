Studying in Morocco provided me with a non-Western perspective on a multitude of global issues. My experience in Morocco, as well as the languages I learned in the US (Spanish and Arabic) has helped me to see through a transnational lens that could be beneficial to my time in the Peace Corps. Studying abroad along with my work experience has prepared me for the challenges that come with serving. While I was in Morocco I learned to cope with homesickness while adapting to Moroccan culture, Islamic law, a new diet, as well as a huge language barrier. I still managed to travel throughout Morocco, conduct interviews with women in rural villages and soak up a breadth of knowledge on Arab traditions. I embraced foods, cultures, languages and ideologies I have never been exposed to while also rolling with the punches of attracting unwanted attention and getting harassed.

Living in Morocco gave me the motivation to commit to a long term goal of mine, which is to educate young girls around the world so they have more career options, while also respecting their culture and religious practices. I was initially drawn to the youth development and education sectors, given that I have had extensive experience working with kids, understanding how they learn, how to engage them, and how to support them mentally and intellectually. I would love the opportunity to help shape our future, and learn from kids while they learn from me. This would be a rewarding experience and I would be forever grateful to serve and integrate myself into a new way of life.
